[yWriter](http://spacejock.com/yWriter7.html) is a free word processor written by Australian author and programmer Simon Haynes. 

When you create a new chapter in yWriter, a Name "Chapter x" is preset with x as chapter number. After moving the chapter, you can invoke a renumbering function. 

Non-English speakers and writers with special requirements for chapter numbering might like the *yw-renumber* software, which offers a little more variability here. Chapters can be numbered with Arabic, Roman or written out in English. In addition, the numbers can be preceded by a prefix and followed by a suffix.

*yw-renumber* works with .yw7 project files. 

The *yw-renumber* script has a graphical user interface. However, a Python 3 installation is required to run it.

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org). Python 3.4 or more recent will work.
